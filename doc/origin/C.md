# Annex C (informative) Process Reference Model for assessment purposes

## C.1 Introduction

Some users of this document may desire to assess the implemented processes in accordance with the ISO/IEC 33000 series standards for process assessment. This annex provides a Process Reference Model (PRM) suitable for use in conjunction with those standards.

The PRM is composed of the processes in the body of this document, including the name, statement of purpose, statement of outcomes for each process. Subclause C.3 identifies the processes in the process reference model and the clauses in which they are defined.

## C.2 Conformance with ISO/IEC 33004

### C.2.1 General

ISO/IEC 33004 subclause 5.3 places requirements on process reference models suitable for assessment by that standard. The following sections quote the ISO/IEC 33004 requirements for process reference models and describe how these are met by this document. In each of the following subclauses the italicized text quotes the requirement from the text of ISO/IEC 33004 and the non‚Äêitalicized (upright) text describes the manner in which the requirement is satisfied in this document.

### C.2.2 Requirements for process reference models
A Process Reference Model shall contain: [ISO/IEC 33020, 5.3.1]

a) A declaration of the domain of the process reference model. This is provided in Clause 1.

b) A description of the relationship between the process reference model and its intended context of use. This is provided by Clause 5.

c) Descriptions, meeting the requirements of [33004] 5.4 [below], of the processes within the scope of the process reference model; This is provided in Clause 6 in the description of each process.

d) A description of the relationship between the processes defined within the process reference model. This is provided in 5.6

The process reference model shall document the community of interest of the model and the actions taken to
achieve consensus within that community of interest: [ISO/IEC 33020, 5.3.2]

a) the relevant community of interest shall be characterized or specified; The relevant community of interest is the users of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.

b) the extent of achievement of consensus shall be documented; Both ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 are international standards satisfying the consensus requirements of ISO/IEC and IEEE. (Not applicable).

c) if no actions are taken to achieve consensus, a statement to this effect shall be documented. (Not applicable).

The processes defined within a process reference model shall have unique process descriptions and identification. [ISO/IEC 33020, 5.3.3] The process descriptions are unique. The identification is provided by unique names and by the clause numbering of this annex.

### C.2.3 Process descriptions

The fundamental elements of a process reference model are the descriptions of the processes within the scope of the model.

The process descriptions in the process reference model incorporate a statement of the purpose of the process, which describes at a high level the overall objectives of performing the process, together with the set of outcomes that demonstrate successful achievement of the process purpose.

A process description shall meet the following requirements:

a) a process shall be described in terms of its purpose and outcomes;

b) the set of process outcomes shall be necessary and sufficient to achieve the purpose of the process; and

c) process descriptions shall not contain or imply aspects of the process quality characteristic beyond the basic level of any relevant process measurement framework conformant with ISO/IEC 33003.

A process outcome describes one of the following: [ISO/IEC 30004:2015, 5.4]

a) production of an artifact;

b) a significant change of state; and

c) meeting of specified constraints, e.g., requirements, goals, etc.

These requirements are met by the process descriptions in Clause 6 of this document. Some outcomes may be interpreted as contributing to levels of capability above level 1 (basic) in some relevant process measurement frameworks. However, conforming implementation of the relevant processes does not require achievement of these higher levels of capability.

## C.3 The process reference model

The Process Reference Model (PRM) is composed of the statement of purpose and outcomes of each of the
included in Clause 6 of this document. The PRM for the software life cycle is composed of the set of
processes in Figure 4, shown previously in 5.6.1 of this document.
