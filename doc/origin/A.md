# Annex A (normative) Tailoring process

## A.1 Introduction

This Annex provides requirements for the tailoring of this document.

NOTE 1 
Tailoring is not a requirement for conformance to this document. In fact, tailoring is not permitted if a claim of “full
conformance” is to be made. If a claim of “tailored conformance” is made, then this process is applied to perform the tailoring.

NOTE 2
Additional guidance for tailoring can be found in ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748 (all parts) on the application of life cycle
processes.

## A.2 Tailoring process

### A.2.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Tailoring process is to adapt the processes of this document to satisfy particular circumstances
or factors that:

a) surround an organization that is employing this document in an agreement;

b) influence a project that is required to meet an agreement in which this document is referenced;

c) reflect the needs of an organization in order to supply products or services.

### A.2.2 Outcomes

As a result of the successful implementation of the Tailoring process:

a) Modified or new life cycle processes are defined to achieve the purposes and outcomes of a life cycle model.

### A.2.3 Activities and tasks

If this document is tailored, then the organization or project shall implement the following tasks in accordance with applicable policies and procedures with respect to the Tailoring process, as required.

a) Identify and record the circumstances that influence tailoring. These influences include, but are not limited to:

1) stability of, and variety in, operational environments;

2) risks, commercial or performance, to the concern of interested parties;

3) novelty, size and complexity;

4) starting date and duration of utilization;

5) integrity issues such as safety, security, privacy, usability, availability;

6) emerging technology opportunities;

7) profile of budget and organizational resources available;

8) availability of the services of enabling systems;

9) roles, responsibilities, accountabilities and authorities in the overall life cycle of the system; and

10) the need to conform to other standards.

b) In the case of properties critical the system, take due account of the life cycle structures recommended or mandated by standards relevant to the dimension of the criticality.

c) Obtain input from parties affected by the tailoring decisions. This includes, but may not be limited to:

1) the system stakeholders;

2) the interested parties to an agreement made by the organization; and

3) the contributing organizational functions.

d) Make tailoring decisions in accordance with the Decision Management process to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the selected life cycle model.

NOTE 1
Organizations establish standard life cycle models as a part of the Life Cycle Model Management process. It is sometimes appropriate for an organization to tailor processes of this document in order to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the stages of a life cycle model to be established.

NOTE 2
Projects select an organizationally‐established life cycle model for the project as a part of the Project Planning process. It is sometimes appropriate to tailor organizationally adopted processes to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the stages of the selected life cycle model.

NOTE 3
In cases where projects are directlypplying this document, it is sometimes appropriate to tailor processes of this document in order to achieve the purposes and outcomes of the stages of a suitable life cycle model.

e) Select the life cycle processes that require tailoring and delete selected outcomes, activities, or tasks.

NOTE 1
Irrespective of tailoring, organizations and projects are always permitted to implement processes that achieve additional outcomes or implement additional activities and tasks beyond those required for conformance to this document.

NOTE 2
An organization or project sometimes encounter a situation where there is the desire to modify a provision of this document. Modification is to be avoided because of unanticipated consequences on other processes, outcomes, activities or tasks. If necessary, modification is performed by deleting the provision (making the appropriate claim of tailored conformance) and, with careful consideration of consequences, implementing a process that achieves additional outcomes or performs additional activities and tasks beyond those of the tailored standard.
