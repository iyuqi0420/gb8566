# Annex B (informative) Examples of process information items

Table B.1 provides a possible set of work products, including artifacts, records, information items, and data stores associated with each process. This list is not all‚Äêinclusive: for each process, an organization may decide to develop a policy, plan, procedures, reports, and records, to demonstrate the outcomes or perform the activities and tasks. Where less intensive documentation is considered sufficient, information items can be combined. Also the organizational policies and procedures can be applied or tailored for each process and project. Typical item titles are shown, including common examples of alternate titles in parentheses.

NOTE
See ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 for guidance on content and management of Information Items.

Artifacts, records, record stores, and information items are usually initiated in one process and revised, enhanced, or completed in other processes. For convenience, they are listed once in this table, in a process where they are commonly initiated. When the software system artifacts and information are transformed or elaborated b another process, traceability is maintained and a traceability mapping can be produced. For example, traceability can be maintained between organizational and project processes, and between requirements, architecture and design elements, and verification cases.
